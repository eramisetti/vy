        <p>

            Born into a family of Yoga and Vedanta practitioners, Sri Subba Rao has been a student of Yoga from a very early age. Guruji, as his students affectionately call him, resigned from a promising career as a senior financial executive to pursue a more meaningful life through Yoga. 
            Since then, yoga is a Pravrutti (a way of relating oneself with the outer world) and Nivrutti (a way of being in touch with the inner self). In short, practicing yoga and teaching yoga has been a way of life for him since then.
            <br><br>
            He has received intense training of more than 5000 hours, in yoga and Vedanta, as a full-time residential trainee, at reputed yoga schools like:
            <li>Svyasa Yoga University, Bengaluru (svyasa.edu.in)</li>
            <li>Sivandashram, Rishikesh (dlshq.org)</li>
            <li>Dayanandashram, Rishikesh (dayananda.org)</li>
            <li>Vivekananda Kendra, Kanyakumari (vrmvk.org)</li>
            <li>Bihar School of Yoga (biharyoga.net)</li>
            <li>Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, New Delhi (yogamdniy.nic.in)</li>
            <br><br>
            Guruji has been teaching yoga and Vedanta for the last 25 years. As a faculty of Svyasa Yoga University, he inspired and trained thousands of Yoga teachers and students in India and the USA. He is passionate about teaching Traditional and Authentic yoga to deepen, inspire, stoke, lead, and guide participants to take tangible steps towards their inner growth. Guruji believes that Yoga in its pristine and authentic form opens a rare opportunity to experience the depth and dimensions of our existence, and helps us grow to our full potential. 
            <br><br>
            To ensure yoga is accessible to all, he has assimilated the best features of different Yoga schools of India and molded them into a unique integrated, holistic, and gentle style.
            <br><br>
            After moving to the USA in 2013, he has conducted about 4o Diabetes Management programs in many cities in the USA in association with Sewa International, sewausa.org, and Svysa.
            <br><br>
            He is the inspiration behind starting Vivekananda Yoga, San Diego a nonprofit yoga organization to spread the message of health, happiness, and harmony in the USA through yoga. With hundreds of yoga teachers and thousands of students trained under it, Vivekananda Yoga, San Diego is a vibrant organization. He is passionate about teaching children and adults alike. His mature and selfless counseling attitude draws students to him. No surprise then that Vivekananda Yoga has hundreds of teacher volunteers, well-wishers, and admirers.

        <p>Paul enjoys inspiring others to practice yoga and to improve their physical and mental health. Paul is also a board member of USA Yoga, a non-profit dedicated to inspiring yoga practice.
        </p>
        <p>He began practicing at age 57 as therapy to relieve knee pain. Two weeks of practice made a big difference. More importantly, Paul began to notice positive mental changes: greater calmness, better reaction to stress, and more patience. From that point on, it only seemed natural to stop and take a yoga class on the drive home from work.
            “I’m amazed at the power of yoga to transform your body and mind. The knee pain that drove me to begin practicing was a blessing."
            The first international yoga championship that he watched inspired him to practice even more. One day a teacher showed him a couple of advanced postures, suitable for use in the competition. Since then he has been in six regional, five national and one international competition. He says that "Preparing for the competitions transformed my practice.”

             Taking the Instructor Course marked the point at which Yoga transformed from being an enthusiasm to being a passion. 
            Mithun is passionately interested in the traditional and holistic forms of yoga, rather than the neo-modern forms. The majority of his practice centres on the traditions of hatha yoga, pranayama and meditation.
            <br><br>
            Mithun practices a primarily Sattvic lifestyle - one that is governed by spiritual principles and harmony. He believes in the healing power of Omkara - the primordial sound.
            <br><br>
            Mithun practices Surya Namaskar and finds that a few quick rounds of Surya Namaskar is very effective at providing a burst of energy that can power the day ahead.
            
            <br><br>
            In addition to practicing Yoga, Mithun engages in various sporting activities like volleyball, badminton, tennis, marathon running etc. Through it all, he believes that Yoga is the glue between the mind-body complex and external activities.

            Mithun volunteers in leading regular weekly yoga classes at his workplace; he also participates in various volunteering activities in support of Vivekananda Yoga.

        <p>
            Ashwini got her first training in teaching Yoga from Yoga Vidya Niketan Mumbai. She got this unique experience under the guidance of Acharya Sadashiv Nimbalkar while pursuing the degree of Physical Therapy, which gave her the opportunity to bring in and practice Yogic techniques complementary to physical therapy.
            Her increasing interest in the field of Yoga brought her to pursue a Master’s degree in Yoga from SVYASA Bangalore, Yoga Institute founded by Dr HR Nagendra, world renowned Yoga Guru. She also had the opportunity to receive RYT200 training, at Vivekananda Yoga San Diego under the guidance of Acharya Subbarao Nemani, which further enhanced her teaching experience.
            <br><br>
            She wants to bring Yoga to every individual for promotion of Positive Health and believes that the practice of Yoga improves health holistically through conditioning the body, regulating the breath, and rejuvenating the spirit. She understands that keeping the body physically, mentally, and emotionally sound is the purpose of Yoga, so we can make the instrument of our existence ready for further and higher spiritual growth.
            <br><br>

            Her passion is to explore Yogic dimensions other than Asanas, Pranayamas, and Kriyas in terms of scriptural understanding. She has an experiential belief that Yoga can bring bliss and contentment, which is contagious and can be spread to the whole universe. Yoga has power to connect the people with the bond of love, bringing health, peace, and harmony.

            For Shubhangi, the journey of Yoga has been fortuitous to say the least. She dabbled in Yoga on and off but never pursued it consistently. That changed during the pandemic. She was eager to try something new, to put her athletic abilities to good use. That is when she heard about the Yoga Teacher training with Vivekananda Yoga and joined this rewarding program in June 2020.
            <br><br>
            Growing up, Shubhangi was an active sportsperson. She even participated in 'Mala-Khamb', an Indian style Aerial Gymnastic arts which needs extreme flexibility. She also served in the youth National Cadet Corps (NCC). The foundational seed to learn Yoga and to become a teacher was sown during those early years.
            <br><br>
            Under Yoga Acharya Sri Subbarao Nemani's (Guruji) tutelage, Shubhangi has realized the true meaning of Yoga. She believes that Yoga is not just about physical advanced asanas, but it also plays a pivotal role in calming the mind and opening a door towards spiritual knowledge that lifts you away from the mundane things in life. She likes the traditional aspects of Yoga such as Hatha, Pranayama, and Meditation. She wants to follow the footsteps of her Guruji and bring this most authentic and traditional form of Yoga to people all over the world.
            <br><br>
            In addition to Yoga, Shubhangi enjoys dancing, hiking, and running marathons. She is also a makeup artist/cosmetologist. Shubhangi volunteers at Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS) and participates in 'Sewa International' non-profit fundraisers.
